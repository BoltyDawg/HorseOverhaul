# HorseOverhaul
A reworking of Minecraft's Vanilla horse breeding and ownership system

FEATURES:
 * AutoGearEquip:
   * Saddles and armor get equipped on the horse when you right click it, rather than opening up their inventory. Can shift click to open the inventory still
 * Better Breeding:
   * new breeding algorithm that provides more generational improvements rather than complete luck
 * BetterBreedingFoodMultipliers:
   * get better results from your breeding by using better foods. 
   * Enchanted golden apples give you a maxed out horse (but it can't breed!), and golden apples make it so you can't do worse than the lower of your two parents!
 * checkHorseStats:
   * right click a tamed horse to check its stats. Compatible with ownership feature
   * store the stats your horses on a sign
 * dropHorseGear:
   -Horses drop their gear upon death
 * Ownership:
   * can't damage your own horse if it's wearing armor
   * claim a horse as yours by clicking on it with a blank deed, or click on it with its existing deed to transfer owners
   * blank deeds name the horse
   * right click an owned foal with shears to "neuter" it: it can't breed, and you can safely sell it to someone
   * Check an owned horse's stats by right clicking it with a carrot on a stick
 * nerfWildHorses:
   * reduce the starting stats of wild horses by a chosen factor (default is 1.5) in order to require players to breed to get the best horses
   * can also override any existing horses (treats any pre-existing horse in your world as "wild", and nerfs it)
